## 🌿 Git Workflow & Best Practices
To ensure a smooth collaboration and keep the project history clean, we follow these git standards:

### 🔹 Branching Strategy
- **`main`**: The stable version of the application.
- **`develop`**: The primary branch for ongoing development.
- **`feature/your-feature`**: For new features.
- **`fix/issue-name`**: For bug fixes.
- **`refactor/module-name`**: For code improvements.

### 🔹 Commit Convention
We follow clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: add claim item functionality`
- `fix: resolve mobile navigation flicker`
- `docs: update readme with git workflow`
- `style: improve warehouse dashboard layout`

### 🔹 Working with Git
1. **Pull often:** Always `git pull origin develop` before starting new work.
2. **Create a branch:** `git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature`.
3. **Commit often:** Small, atomic commits are easier to review.
4. **Push & PR:** Push your branch and create a Pull Request for review.
